I Worked well independently and on a team to solve problems. But mainly i worked independently. I independently had to configure the Rack Server for the server so People across South Africa could join the Game Server. I also had to setup a Team Speak server on Debian via ssh. I independently optimized the server to run a smooth 100+ FPS (Frames per second) with more than 100+ Players on at once."
